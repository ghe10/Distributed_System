Important message: Coordiantor machine (the one that helps other machines to join)
Coordinator : Machine 1 for group 20 (with ip 172.22.148.194, this is hard coded in our code)
This machine should be started first, otherwise other machines can't find each other.

Here is the commands we implemented for our MP2:
1. list: list all the machines in membership list
2. leave: volunteer to leave the system, this leave is marked in log.log.
3. join: rejoin this machine to the system after leave command. This will help a machine to join a system when the coordinator is online.
         When the coordinator is down, you can't  join the system
4. grep: used to grep log file.
         eg. : grep fail
5. prob: used to set package loss rate. First, type “prob” and press “Enter”, 
         then type the new package loss rate(eg. 0.03) and press “Enter” again.  
         The default loss rate is 0.
