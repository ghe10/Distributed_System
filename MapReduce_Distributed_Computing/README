This is the full version of our "cloud computing platform". It contains:
(1) log system
(2) SWIM based failure detector for multiple failures
(3) sdfs: distributed file system, 3 replicas for each file
(4) computing system, maple-juice computing platform (very similar to map resuce). 

commands:
1.	grep: grep log file, which is similar to MP1.
2.	list: show membership list.
3.	selfId: show slef IP and timestamp.
4.	Leave: volunteer to leave the group while keep all the files. (Note that the remaining nodes will try to add new replicas to maintain 3 replicas of each file)
5.	join: join the system after a leave.
6.	put: put a local file to sdfs. Called as “put localFileName” or “put localFileName globalFileName”.
7.	delete: delete a file in sdfs. Called as “delete sdfsFileName”.
8.	request: request the sdfs to send a file back to local folder. Called as “request sdfsFileName” or “request sdfsFileName localFileName”.
9.	store: list the files stored at a node.
10.	ls: list the ips that a file is stored on. Called as “ls sdfsFileName”. 
11. cloud computing commands examples:
    mode  exe            num   prefix   input file   outputfile  upload_small_files  isfolder  delete_intermid_file
    maple wordCountMap    3    midVM    vm1.log                       1                 false	
    juice linkGraphReduce 3    midGraph             GraphOutPut                                   0

    Note: make sure you have put the data and exe files into sdfs before start using our "cloud computing" functionality.
    
Nice to work with my lovely VMs!!!!!!!
